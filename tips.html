        <p>When feeding hold the food by the tail with the head very close the the snakes face, this ensures that the snake grabs the prey easiest and eats it head first... this is a dumb animal and may still mess this up.</p>
        <p>If the prey is not warm enough when you want to feed, use a hair dryer to warm it up.</p>
        <p>If you are having a tough time maintaining ambient temps you can use a space heater nearby.</p>
        <p>When still young pay attention to where their body is if they are near an area where they may fall.</p>
        <p>BPs are curious animals and are known to escape, so do not enter into a situation where it can escape or get lost, always make sure the lid on the habitat is secure and held down. Or sliding door tight, they can figure out how to nudge them open if they are loose.</p>
        <p>Reading care sheets doesn't cover everything you can learn, as much as we try to bring up everything you may need to know there is just always stuff that can only be learned by doing, so expect to encounter difficulties and the unexpected once you have your snake.</p>
        <p>Do not get concerned when you do not see them drinking water, this is rare to see since they do it briefly at night.</p>
        <p>A hiding BP is a happy BP.</p>
        <p>Some of the best sources on snakes are snake discovery on youtube, and Clint's reptiles on youtube. These are endless resources of snake knowledge built upon years of experience, they are very informative while also being engaging and just all around amazing people worth giving some time to.</p>

        <p>BPs are so popular for the reason they have so many morphs and their genetics are easy to work with. A person can actively explore phenotype expression in live animals easily with Ball Pythons.
        There are so many cool patterns and colours and various combinations you can search and find what you want.</p>

        <p>The basic phenotypic expression that you will find in the wild is called the "wild type". This is just the pattern and color that best suits the animals current environment. Often the wild type fits into the surrounding natural environment very well.<img src="../animal-care/images/wild.png"></p>
        <p>One of the most popular morphs are pieds, meaning the animal has 2 or more colors expressed, and in ball pythons this results in a combination of pure white and the expression of another color pattern. These are in high demand and fetch a high price.<img src="../animal-care/images/pied.jpeg"></p>
        <p>A controversial morph is the spider Ball Python, rather than big blotches of color the spider has very thin patterns liken to a spiders web. But what makes it controversial is the fact they all exhibit a movement impairment called a wobble or corkscrew. this results in shaking and difficulty moving in various severity, at the best the snake will just shake a little when stimulated, and at the worst the snake will spin it's head and body severly and be extremely disoriented.
            This is likely due to the gene that codes for the spider pattern incidentaly also codes for disoriented movement. <img src="../animal-care/images/spider.png"></p>
        <p>Another cool morph is the leucistic, this is a nearly all white BP and really stands out when compared to other morphs. leucism is only a partial loss of melanin (melanin is a dark pigment that results in dark colours), often resulting in these snakes having blue eyes. This is different than albinism where the animal has no melanin at all, even the eyes will not show any dark color.<img src="../animal-care/images/leucistic.png"> </p>
        <p>There are so many different morphs that it comes down to whatever appeals to you, so thru your travels you are bound to find some that really catch your eye.</p>

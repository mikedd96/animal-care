        <p>Ball Pythons are not an overly active animal, they are slow, nocturnal, and not very smart. They are easy to predict and can be boring to watch.
            This means they are suitable to be handled and not ideal to just watch. They do most of their activity at night, and you will likely almost never see them drink unless you stay up all night watching them every minute.
            It is absolutley fine to handle them during the day tho, they do not mind, but you will find they may just want to be curled up if you handle during the day or they will look for somewhere dark and warm.
            BPs are a curious animal when active, so they will be looking around and moving wherever they please... usually this is just towards somewhere dark and warm and tight.
            they are not an aggressive animal at all, if they are aggresive towards you then you will want to think of why that may be, remember aggression is their last resort. they are known to "periscope" where they lift their neck and head to look around and if observing something in particular like you they will follow with their head.
            Most of their life and behaviour will be spent curled up somewhere dark and warm that just fits them.
            You may see yours burrow under substrate or push over plants as a burrowing behaviour, this is totally fine.

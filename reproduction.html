    <p>*This is not a breeding guide, it is just quick breeding info a begginer should know about the topic.*
        <br>when the time comes that you want to breed, please look into some full guides on the topic on other websites.</p>
    <p>Breeding</p>
    <p>Breeding requires a male and female BP that have both reached sexual maturity. We want to focus on weight as the primary factor to determining breeding maturity since BPs tend to grow at different rates. We want both males and females to have a safe weight before breeding so if they lose weight during breeding they still remain healthy. 
        Males you typically want to have a weight of 800g before entering into breeding. Females require a lot more time and size due to the fact they will be carrying the eggs and producing the nutrients needed for the young to grow in the egg, females should be atleast 1500g before entering into breeding, and 2-3 years old.
        Ball Pythons breed by "Locking", where the male and female will lock and curl their tails together so their cloacas are in contact with eachother (the cloaca is where the reproductive organs, as well as the exit of the digestive tract, is located).
        Breeding is usually started in the fall. The male and female will be paired together for a few hours to a few days at a time. The amount of time spent together differs on preferences of the keeper. Next ovulation occurs where the female develops the eggs, this may take 6-8 weeks, and the female will visably thicken up and colors may change to more of a contrast, she may also show behaviour changes.
        For the several hours it takes for her to lay the eggs the new mother should be left alone. Once eggs are laid they will take roughly 2 months to hatch.

    <p>Sexing</p>
    <p>BPs are not sexually dimorphic (other than size), meaning males and females do not show different physical charactersitics. The two sexes do differ in growth rate and size, but size is not a trustworthy tell. Rather the proper and trustworthy method is "Probing", where a prob is sliped into a pocket at the vent where their cloaca and spurs are located. The probe will only going in about 1-3 scales towards the end of their tail, and males the probe will go much futher, 9-15 scales down. Probing should only be done by well experienced keepers due to safety hazards of the snake.</p>

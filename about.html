            <p>The best way to begin to understand an animal is to learn about its natural habitat and everything happening in its natural environment. after all this it is the environment that shaped this animal as it was evolving for thousands to millions of years. Ball Pythons are natural to the grasslands of the western central belt of Africa. Here the nightly temps can drop as low as 54°F (12°C) or shoot up to 100°F (38°C), but average 68°F (21°C) to 93°F (34°C). Here they like to hide out in things such as burrows or empty termite mounds where they are hidden from predators and remain in an insulated area, this behaviour carries on to pythons bred in captivity, so you will notice yours loves to hide in small areas to feel safe.
                Ball Pythons are most often seen curled up in a ball, hence the name <i>Ball</i> Python, They do this to conserve energy and heat and to feel safe, they tuck their head into their body so it isn't visible, this makes them a little harder to distinguish for predators, plus curled up and head hidden is just a natural safe position for all animals. you should be able to draw parellels between the description of a BP in its natural environment and what you see yours do.
            The habitats we create are meant to simulate their natural environment but remove any extremes and remove the chance of harm. The guidelines for care presented by this and any other husbandry sheet is based off natural environments then tested and dialed in as the years go on. BPs have not been kept in captivity where we record best practices for all that long, it was only in the 90s that BPs exploded in popularity, so you can think of that as when good record keeping started. They have been kept as a pet by keepers for much longer but it is best to ignore any info that is old and follow the most modern practices and information you can.
        Pythons as a genus are known for their heat pits on the front of their faces (tho it should be noted not all species of Pythons have heat pits). These heat pits are used to detect the warm blooded small mammals they prey on since they do not have great vision, The heat pits are also used to find and monitor the temperatures of their surroundings so they know where they can stay in places with the temperatures their body needs to function. Snakes are a cold blooded animal, this means their body does not naturally regulate the temperatures its organs need to function. Being coldblooded conserves energy so the snake is more suited to an unreliable and unpredictable environment where its prey may not come along for quite some time.
    Snakes also have a "Jacobson's organ", this is a sensory organ similiar to our nose. The Jacobson's organ is located at the roof of the mouth towards the front where a nasal cavity is typically located. The organ has 2 openings similar to our 2 nasal openings... and similiar to a snake's forked tongue. The snake flicks it's tongue out to detect and collect organic compunds in the air, then bring it's tongue back in where those 2 ends of the fork fit into the 2 openings of the jacobson's organ, this allows the snake to learn about it's immediate environment from the organic compounds in the air, just like how we breath in those compunds into our nose. Snakes do still have nostrils that are used to breath tho, and to a lesser extent smell, but they get a much better sense using their tongue and the jacobson's organ.
    Speaking of breathing, snakes need a way to breath while they swallow such large prey whole. In order for them to do this snakes have a glottis, which is a small tube from near the tongue down to the trachea and lung (yes lung, snakes tend to only have one lung). While swallowing food the snake will move the glottis to the side out of the way of food and since this organ is rigid it can still function without being blocked.
    Since Ball Pythons have little to no defensive or offensive features their behaviour becomes simple and predictable. With the lack of features available, the fight or flight instinct is reduced to flight. Tho they do still have that mouth and a pitiful set of teeth that is only suited to gripping it's food, they can still bite, but only as a last resort because a striking bite requires alot more energy than hiding, moving away, or just curling up in a ball.
    Ball pythons are a very simple animal and because of that they are alot of fun to learn about since they have very minimal anatomy and characteristics, but what they do have is still recognizable to us and we can identify it to what we are familiar with.

            <p>You can make use of this information by building the habitat as similiar to what their natural environment is like, as well, think about this when you notice a behaviour that you think is concerning. Every new keeper has things happen in the habitat or sees behaviour that causes them concern, but with more information about the species alot of these concerns can be solved.</p>

        <h4>Required and Recommended Housing</h4>

        <h5>Here is a quick list of need to haves, it is not necessary to have more than these for your snake.</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Enclosure</li>
            <li>Substrate</li>
            <li>Heating pad</li>
            <li>Water Dish</li>
            <li>Hides</li>
            <li>tongs for feeding</li>
            <li>Thermometer</li>
            <li>humidistat</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Trust me, it is much easier that it looks. I will go in depth on each item further on</p>
        
        <h5>Enclosure</h5>
        <p>A good rule For enclosure size is at a minimum the snake should have enough room to stretch out along the front/back and one side.
            Generally <b>juveniles</b> can be housed in a <b>20 gallon</b> enclosure, and <b>adults</b> in at least a <b>40 Gallon</b> but what matters is the length x width rather than the depth.
            As for what type of enclosure there are multiple options, covering all price ranges.</p>


        <p><span>Sterilite tubs</span> are an ideal solution due to their accesibility, low price and ability to hold heat and humidity.
            You can easily pick up a 26 gallon tub for under <b>20$</b> from any large store such as Wal-mart or Home-Depot. which will work great for the first year or so of your juveniles life.
            These are wonderful to use for a tank! Their clear sides allow for viewing and light to get in, and latching lid is easy to open and lock when needed, as well what could be easier to move around.
            But what matters is how well they hold humidity and heat, due to being fully enclosed with no screen lid once you have your ideal humidity and heat, it will remain at that ideal setting with ease tho hat inside may floctuate more closely with room temperature outise the tank which can be less than ideal depending on your room.
            most people will drill or melt holes near the top for airflow, you can use the ammount of holes as a sort of select setting if you find you are having trouble with heat or humidity by increasing the number of holes or blocking some,
             but a single row of holes along all 4 sides about 2 - 3 inches apart seems to work well.  
        </p>

        <p><span>PVC tanks</span> are a more perminant solution since they are usually purpose made for reptile housing and come in most common sizes that align with various pet requirements such as 40 gallons.
            You can find these online or at manufacture stores for around <b>250$</b> but that price will range.These are built with the same material as sterilite tubs so they have the same humidity/heat benefits.
            you will find these generally with sliding or latching doors and the rest of the tank built solid so there is little to no risk of escape, and high durability.
            These may even be built with a spot for a heating mat or built in heating mat or even a water dish, but that is usually reseved for expensive enclosures.
             overall these are a very simple and most ideal way to house your snake.
     </p>

        <p><span>Glass tanks</span> are certainly an acceptable enclosure tho not as ideal as the pvc options.
        Many people have had trouble keeping humidity levels where they need to be because of the mesh top. Tho they are quite good at retaining heat.
        These can also crack and break, as well they are very heavy, but for some reason common. When you see encolsure kits made by Zoo med, and Exo terra at your local pet store they are glass.
        these can also be expensive to buy <b>300$</b>. But what they do have going for them is most families will have one from an old fish tank with may do the trick for you,
        or buying second hand for cheap if not free.</p>

    <div class="substrate">
        <h4>Reccomended types of bedding</h4>
        <p>When choosing substrate your main concerns will be: Aesthetics,  how it affects humidity, how easy it is to burrow in,  how likely it is to mold, impaction if swallowed, and toxixcity. Some may consider odor absorption a wanted trait in substrate, but odors are a great indicator if anything out of the ordinary is going on. Here I will just cover what is reccomended. In practice any of the reccomended substrates will do wonderful job so your main concern can just be how it will look. There are lots of substrates but please stick to what is reccomended, not what is easiest</p>
        
        <h5>coco fiber</h5>

        <p>Coco fiber looks and acts very much like regular soil, but is made from just the fibers from coconuts so it is quite attractive. It is probably the best for holding humidity so while that is a plus you will want to mixing and turning it every now and then to reduce chance of molding, which should be done anyway for all substrates since your snake will compact it from their weight. Since the fibers are small the chance of impaction after swallowing is low and the ability to be burrowed in is high.</p>
        <img src="../animal-care/images/coco-friber.jpg" alt="coco fiber">

        <h5>Bio active</h5>

        <p>This one is for the experienced, as I can say from personal experience it may seem really cool to do, but it takes a lot of work and care that a someone new to this stuff just is not suited for. you are learning so don't pile your plate to high.
            You can find plenty of guides online that will go in depth on creating a bio-active habitat. But in short it is for the most part a self regulating habitat that has living plants and micro-organisms that help clean waste and shed skin. It is generally thought of as the most aesthetic and the coolest, as well the soild works wonderfully for burrowing.
        </p>
        <img src="../animal-care/images/bio-active.jpg" alt="bio active">

        <h5>Coconut husk</h5>

        <p>Cocu husk is quite similiar to Coco fiber, except it is made from the fibers as well as large chunks of husk. It is considered the best overall for moisture retention if you want high humidity levels. where it differs from fiber tho is husks do not make a good bedding for burrowing, and the larger chunks are more likely to cause impaction.</p>
        <img src="../animal-care/images/coco-husk.jpg" alt="coco husk">
        <h5>Cypress mulch</h5>

        <p>Cypress mulch is wonderful for humidity, tho you may want to mist every now and then to keep it from drying. Due to large chunks cypress doesn't make great burrows and can cause impaction.</p>
        <img src="../animal-care/images/cypress-mulch.jpg" alt="cypress mulch">
        <h5>Aspen mulch</h5>

        <p>Aspen mulch is similiar to cypress, but tends to be difficult for humidity levels, it will likely have smaller pieces that make it easier to burrow. Aspen is readily available and easier to find than other substrates, as well as being cheaper, tho you do risk the aspen carrying mites.</p>
        <img src="../animal-care/images/aspen-mulch.jpg" alt="aspen mulch">
        <h5>Paper towel/newspaper</h5>

        <p>As you can guess paper towel is not ideal for a perminant habitat due to doing almost none of the points we look for is substrate well. But what it is useful for is short term, if you are transporting your snake then paper towel is the way to go, or if you are just making an enclosure for babies. If you are someone who decides to feed your BP outside of its habitat, it is reccomended to feed it in another enclosureon paper towel.</p>

    <div class="heating">
        <h4>Heating your habitat, and getting the right humidity</h4>
        <p>Temperatures for reptile care are often reffered to in farenheit, we will typically be working with 70° to 95° farenheit (21° to 35° celsius).
            The two temperature areas you will want to take care of first are the <b>warm end 87°f - 92°f (30°c - 33°c)</b> and the <b>cool end 75°f - 80°f (24°c - 27°c)</b>. This is your temperature base and the rest of your temps will align themselves as long as these temps are there.
            temperatures are dynamic and will fluctuate with the time of day and time of year so as long as yours are within the range you are doing fine. At night temps drop outside in their natural habitat so yours will and should to as it simulates their natural habitat, a drop of around 5 - 10 °f is fine.
            All of this together works to create an ambient air gradient inside your enclosure  to allow your BP to choose where he wants to be and regulate their own temp by simply going where they want to be. It is also reccomended you have a hide in the warm end and a hide in the cool end so they can feel safe wherever they need to be.
            you will notice behaviour changes depending on the temperatures, if temps are not ideal you will see your snake acting more subdued than normal.
            <span>you will want to own for sure a heating pad the apropriate size for your enclosure, and while not necessary but highly reccomended is a thermostat connected to your heating pad to regulate and set desired temp, you will also want a thermometer and possibly even a temperature gun to measure direct temps.</span> 
        </p>
        <div class="heating-photos">
            <img src="../animal-care/images/ipower.jpg" alt="heating pad">

            <img src="../animal-care/images/temp gun.jpg" alt="temp gun">
        </div>
        <p> Humidity is simpler, in short you want a little over medium humidity, so <b>60% to 80%</b>, in their natural habitat it can drop to in the 40s so if that happens temporarily that is not the worst. As long as you have a water bowl inside that should be enough to maintain about a 60% depending on size of enclosure, and if you want to increase how humid it is you can simpler have more water or put the water on the warm end where it will evaporate into the air.
            When it comes time to shed it is often a good idea to increase humidity over 80%, tho don't keep humidity that high for weeks on end as that can lead to scale rot, and create an environment where mold and bacteria can live in the substrate.
            <span>For humidity all you need to own is a humidistat.</span>
        </p>

    </div>
    <div class="water">
        <h4>Water dish</h4>
        <p>This one is simple, just fill up a dish with water that they can easily access to drink, they may even soak all or aprt of their body in here. Just change it every day or two.</p>
        <img src="../animal-care/images/waterdish.jpg" alt="water dish">

    </div>
    
    <div class="hides">
        <h4>Hides and decor</h4>
        <p>Here you get to make ther habitat look how you want, please do not consult your snake of the interior decorating of their habitat as they do not have an opinion and have pretty poor sight. As long as they have a hide on the warm end and another one on the cool end where they can feel secure they are happy, you will also want soemthing rough they can rub on while they shed to coax the skin off. you may choose to add branches, bark, flowers to make it look natural, or go a whole nother route wherever you imagination takes you. As long as their needs are met you are free to amke it look how you want.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="tongs">
        <h4>feeding tongs</h4>
        <p>Super simple here, just tongs to hold the rat for feeding, don't go without it as sometimes the snake can miss their strike. Mostly you will find available large tweazer tongs but I can say these sometimes such at holding onto the rat, cooking tongs that open and close like scissors are much easier and offer a good grip.</p>

    <div class="overview">
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>I realize that covered alot of options, but Ball pythons are one of the simplest animals to care for.
            As long as you have the 8 reccomended items listed at the top and of them choose one of the listed reccomended options, after that just keep your temperatures and humidity in the recomended zone and that is all you need, next just look at feeding.

        <h4>Required and Recommended Housing</h4>

        <h5>Here is a quick list of need to haves, it is not necessary to have more than these for your snake.</h5>

            <li>Enclosure</li>
            <li>Substrate</li>

            <li>Thermometer</li>
            <li>humidistat</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Trust me, it is much easier that it looks. I will go in depth on each item further on</p>
        
        <h5>Enclosure</h5>
        <p>A good rule For enclosure size is at a minimum the snake should have enough room to stretch out along the front/back and one side.
            Generally <b>juveniles</b> can be housed in a <b>20 gallon</b> enclosure, and <b>adults</b> in at least a <b>40 Gallon</b> but what matters is the length x width rather than the depth.
            As for what type of enclosure there are multiple options, covering all price ranges.</p>

        <img src="../animal-care/images/sterilite-tub.jpg" alt="Sterilite Tub">
        <p><span>Sterilite tubs</span> are one of the best solutions due to their accesibility, low price and ability to hold heat and humidity.
            You can easily pick up a 26 gallon tub for under <b>20$</b> from any large store such as Wal-mart or Home-Depot. which will work great for the first year or so of your juveniles life.
            These are wonderful to use for a tank! Their clear sides allow for viewing and light to get in, and latching lid is easy to open and lock when needed, as well what could be easier to move around.
            But what matters is how well they hold humidity and heat, due to being fully enclosed with no screen lid once you have your ideal humidity and heat, it will remain at that ideal setting with ease tho hat inside may floctuate more closely with room temperature outise the tank which can be less than ideal depending on your room.
            most people will drill or melt holes near the top for airflow, you can use the ammount of holes as a sort of select setting if you find you are having trouble with heat or humidity by increasing the number of holes or blocking some,
             but a single row of holes along all 4 sides about 2 - 3 inches apart seems to work well.  
        </p>

        <img src="../animal-care/images/pvc.jpg" alt="PVC Tank">
        <p><span>PVC tanks</span> are a more perminant solution since they are usually purpose made for reptile housing and come in most common sizes that align with various pet requirements such as 40 gallons.
            You can find these online or at manufacture stores for around <b>250$</b> but that price will range.These are built with the same material as sterilite tubs so they have the same humidity/heat benefits.
            you will find these generally with sliding or latching doors and the rest of the tank built solid so there is little to no risk of escape, and high durability.
            These may even be built with a spot for a heating mat or built in heating mat or even a water dish, but that is usually reseved for expensive enclosures.
             overall these are a very simple and most ideal way to house your snake.
     </p>

        <img src="../animal-care/images/glass-tank.jpg" alt="Glass Tank">
        <p><span>Glass tanks</span></p> are certainly an acceptable enclosure tho not as ideal as the pvc options.
        Many people have had trouble keeping humidity levels where they need to be because of the mesh top. Tho they are quite good at retaining heat.
        These can also crack and break, as well they are very heavy, but for some reason common. When you see encolsure kits made by Zoo med, and Exo terra at your local pet store they are glass.
        these can also be expensive to buy <b>300$</b>. But what they do have going for them is most families will have one from an old fish tank with may do the trick for you,
        or buying second hand for cheap if not free.

    <div class="substrate">
        <h4>Reccomended types of bedding</h4>
        <p>When choosing substrate your main concerns will be: Aesthetics,  how it affects humidity, how easy it is to burrow in,  how likely it is to mold, impaction if swallowed, and toxixcity. Some may consider odor absorption a wanted trait in substrate, but odors are a great indicator if anything out of the ordinary is going on. Here I will just cover what is reccomended. In practice any of the reccomended substrates will do wonderful job so your main concern can just be how it will look. There are lots of substrates but please stick to what is reccomended, not what is easiest</p>
        
        <h5>coco fiber</h5>
        <img src="../animal-care/images/coco-friber.jpg" alt="coco fiber">
        <p>Coco fiber looks and acts very much like regular soil, but is made from just the fibers from coconuts so it is quite attractive. It is probably the best for holding humidity so while that is a plus you will want to mixing and turning it every now and then to reduce chance of molding, which should be done anyway for all substrates since your snake will compact it from their weight. Since the fibers are small the chance of impaction after swallowing is low and the ability to be burrowed in is high.</p>
        
        <h5>Bio active</h5>
        <img src="../animal-care/images/bio-active.jpg" alt="bio active">
        <p>This one is for the experienced, as I can say from personal experience it may seem really cool to do, but it takes a lot of work and care that a someone new to this stuff just is not suited for. you are learning so don't pile your plate to high.
            You can find plenty of guides online that will go in depth on creating a bio-active habitat. But in short it is for the most part a self regulating habitat that has living plants and micro-organisms that help clean waste and shed skin. It is generally thought of as the most aesthetic and the coolest, as well the soild works wonderfully for burrowing.
        </p>

        <h5>Coconut husk</h5>
        <img src="../animal-care/images/coco-husk.jpg" alt="coco husk">
        <p>Cocu husk is quite similiar to Coco fiber, except it is made from the fibers as well as large chunks of husk. It is considered the best overall for moisture retention if you want high humidity levels. where it differs from fiber tho is husks do not make a good bedding for burrowing, and the larger chunks are more likely to cause impaction.</p>

        <h5>Cypress mulch</h5>
        <img src="../animal-care/images/cypress-mulch.jpg" alt="cypress mulch">
        <p>Cypress mulch is wonderful for humidity, tho you may want to mist every now and then to keep it from drying. Due to large chunks cypress doesn't make great burrows, and can cause impaction.</p>

        <h5>Aspen mulch</h5>
        <img src="../animal-care/images/aspen-mulch.jpg" alt="aspen mulch">
        <p>Aspen mulch is similiar to cypress, but tends to be difficult for humidity levels, it will likely have smaller pieces that make it easier to burrow. Aspen is readily available and easier to find than other substrates, as well as being cheaper, tho you do risk the aspen carrying mites.</p>

        <h5>Paper towel/newspaper</h5>
        <img src="../animal-care/images/newspaper.jpg" alt="news paper habitat">
        <p>As you can guess paper towel is not ideal for a perminant habitat due to doing almost none of the points we look for is substrate well. But what it is useful for is short term, if you are transporting your snake then paper towel is the way to go, or if you are just making an enclosure for babies. If you are someone who decides to feed your BP outside of its habitat, it is reccomended to feed it in another enclosureon paper towel.</p>

        <p class="d1"><b>The #1 difficulty you will hear about with ball pythons is they are notoriously picky eaters.</b>
        While they can be picky, this is a little overblown for possibly a few reasons. BPs are an easy and hardy pet so the few problems they do have will get more attention.
     All BPs can and will go off food for a period of time at some point in their life, and this is normal, so if you see it just know that there are a few minor steps to take to make sure it is not a problem with the environment, snake, or food. If you see your Python has cloudy eyes then theya re likely in shed and may not be hungry because this is a stressful time for them, so leave them be. The food may be the wrong temp, you want it to be warm (all snakes have different personalities and yours may just be a son of a bitch and be picky). When feeding food of various temps you will notice your snakes accuracy on strike differ, with colder food your python will have a tough time sensing it and will be slow to find it and is more likely to miss it's strike.
    You will want to make sure you have correct heat in the habitat, and correct humidity, if these are within the acceptable range go over a care sheet and check everything going on in your habitat is normal. Next check to see if there are any environmental changes since the last time they fed and were comfortable.
    If all is normal wait and try feeding in a few days or whenever your next scheduled feeding date is. This can go on anywhere from a few weeks to several months, BP's can absolutely just refuse food because they don't want it.
    You can absolutely feed by holding the food directly in front of their face, even as far as lightly touching their nose.</p>
        <p class="d2"><b>Humidity for some keepers can be a tough factor to get right.</b>Humidity is affected by many things such as the substrate, the type of enclosure, the outside room and climate of the area you live in, as well as the amount of water in your water bowl.
    Simplest solution to this problem is to keep a humistat in the habitat and check it every now and again. If it reads far off of where you want it then you may need to look into getting substrate that hold humidity better, you can also just spray the habitat down with water to get things right. If your humidity is off by only a little you can simply keep your water dish filled at a higher level, or/and move it to a warmer part of the habitat where it can evaporate faster.</p>
        <p class="d3"><b>Sheds may take some effort on your part to get right, and if your snake cannot shed right this can cause stress and physical problems</b>
        Sheds depend heavily on the humidity, but just because your humidity is right doesn't mean shed will go perfect. You may find you need to boost your humidity even higher when your BP goes into shed. If you want to make it even esaier on them make a humidity box, place some extra damp but not soaking substrate (note: not all substrates are appropriate to use here) or moss into a bowl inside of a hide so your snake can curl up on it.</p>
